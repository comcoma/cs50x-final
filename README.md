# cs50x-final

IdeaCloud is my final project at CS50x and it's supposed to be a website where developers can find ideas for new projects that are actually meaningful and submitted by real people. That way you won't have to spend your time on randomly generated ideas that are useful only for putting them in your portfolio. You can work on a project which will benefit the community.

IdeaCloud uses Python/Flask, SQLite database and Bootstrap. It lets any registered user add their ideas and/or vote for existing ones.
